"synth.py" is a simple concatenative speech synthesizer. Requires a folder "monophones" with wav files for each monophone (not uploaded, as it belongs to the University of Edinburgh)
Example1: -p "HELLO. i was born {22/01} with {3.14} or, 344 cats"
Example2: -p "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet"
** Still to upload: Festival speech synthesis projects **
