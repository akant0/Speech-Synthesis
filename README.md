"synth.py" is a simple concatenative speech synthesizer. 

Requires a folder "monophones" with wav files for each monophone (not uploaded, as it belongs to the University of Edinburgh)
Synthesizer normalizes text (dates, numbers, caps, etc.), adds pauses with punctuation and emphasizes with {word}.

example1.wav: -p "HELLO. i was born {22/01} with {3.14} or, 344 cats"

example2.wav: -p "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet"

** Still to upload: Festival speech synthesis projects **
